# Lab-Monitoring-System
As a Lab Assistant at Jetking, I managed 50+ PCs, which earlier required manual checks for hardware, software, and performance issues. To optimize this, I built an Automated Lab PC Monitoring System that collects system data on boot, sends it to AWS, and displays it on a real-time dashboard with alerts saving time and ensuring reliable PCs.
